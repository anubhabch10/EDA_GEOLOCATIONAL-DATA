High Level Approach:
high

Fetch Datasets from the relevant locations (Data Collection)
Clean the Datasets to prepare them for analysis. (Data Cleaning via Pandas)
Visualise the data using boxplots. (Using Matplotlib /Seaborn /Pandas)
Fetch Geolocational Data from the Foursquare API. (REST APIs)
Use K-Means Clustering to cluster the locations (Using ScikitLearn)
Present findings on a map. (Using Folium/Seaborn)
The end result looks something like this:
